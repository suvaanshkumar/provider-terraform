  # Note that unlike most provider configs this one supports an array of
  # credentials. This is because each Terraform workspace uses a single
  # Crossplane provider config, but could use multiple Terraform providers each
  # with their own credentials.
  # This optional configuration block can be used to inject HCL into any
  # workspace that uses this provider config, for example to setup Terraform
  # providers.

      // Modules _must_ use remote state. The provider does not persist state.
